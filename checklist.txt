Networking Requirements
Synchronous bidirectional communication (N1)

[x] Ensure server and client can send and receive messages synchronously.

Connection and disconnection handling (N2)

[x] Properly manage connections and disconnections without server-side errors.

[x] Implement error handling for unexpected disconnections.

Error handling and message content verification (N3, N5)

[x] Implement server-side error handling and message verification.

[x] Ensure client-side error handling and message verification.

Support multiple clients (N4)

[x] Verify server's ability to handle multiple concurrent client connections using asyncio.

Asynchronous bidirectional communication (N6)

[x] Ensure server and client can send and receive messages asynchronously.

Shared state information (N7)

[] Implement mechanisms to share state information between clients and the server.

Layered network code (N8)

[x] Separate network code from application logic for modularity.

Security Requirements
Encrypted network traffic (S1, S2)

[x] Use SSL/TLS for encrypted communication.

[x] Implement Diffie-Hellman key exchange for secure key negotiation.

Prevent attacks (S3)

[x] Implement mechanisms to prevent SQL injections.

AAA implementation (S4)

[x] Implement authentication (login), authorization (admin vs. regular users), and auditing (log user actions).

Application Requirements
Multiple states based on user input (A1)

[x] Implement at least 2 states that alter system behavior based on user input (e.g., LOGIN, REGISTER).

Complex state with persistent data (A2)

[x] Implement a state that allows data to be stored between sessions (e.g., storing user and food data in a SQLite database).

Complex state altering network communication (A3)

[x] Implement a state that allows the client to send an arbitrary number of messages in a row.

Additional Features
Heartbeat mechanism (N9)

[ ] Implement a heartbeat mechanism for maintaining connections.

Data encryption on storage (S5)

[x] Encrypt user data (e.g., passwords) before storing in the database.

User password resets and account lockouts (S5, S6)

[ ] Implement features for user password resets and account lockouts.

Multiple additional features (N10, S6)

[x] Implement multiple features, such as secure communication and encryption.
