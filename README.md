# Secure Calorie Tracker (Client-Server Application)

This project is a secure, networked calorie tracking system built with Python. It allows users to register, log in, track food intake, and manage user data through a graphical interface. Admin users can monitor client activity and logs.

## Features

### ‚úÖ Functional Requirements
- Login and registration system with hashed passwords and salt using **scrypt**.
- GUI-based client built with **CustomTkinter**.
- Secure SSL/TLS encrypted communication using custom certificates.
- Diffie-Hellman key exchange for secure shared key generation.
- Persistent storage with **SQLite** for user credentials and food data.
- Calorie tracker showing current day consumption and remaining allowance.
- Admin panel with log viewing and user list access.
- Handles disconnections, multiple clients, and various input errors.
- Logging of all major server events to `server.log`.

### üîê Security Highlights
- SSL certificates used (`server.crt`, `server.key`) to encrypt network communication.
- Parameterized SQL queries to prevent injection attacks.
- Account lockout after 4 failed login attempts.
- Logging of login attempts and data access for audit purposes.
